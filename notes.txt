Lecture 1 Reference counting & variables

variable : variables are memory address references of objects at which they are stored. in other word, variables are pointers too.


Heap :In computer science, a heap is a specialized tree-based data structure which is essentially an almost complete[1] tree that satisfies the heap property: in a max heap, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is greater than or equal to the key of C. In a min heap, the key of P is less than or equal to the key of C.[2] The node at the "top" of the heap (with no parents) is called the root node.


memory reference count : counts how many variables are refering to a single object.
i.e. a = 5,  n = a, now both a and n are refering int object 5 so, reference count = 2, but when no variable refers a object then python memory manager frozes that object automatically.
